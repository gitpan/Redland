<h1 align="center">Redland RDF Application Framework - Installation Instructions</h1>


<h2>1. Getting the sources</h2>

<p>There are several ways to get the sources.  The most stable and
tested versions are the sources shipped with each release and these
are recommended as the first place to start.  If you want to get a
newer set, then there are nightly snapshots made of the development
sources, which may not yet be committed to the CVS.  For the latest
developent sources, anonymous CVS access is available but this may
require some configuring of developer tools that are not needed for
the snapshot releases.</p>

<p>The source bundle and package files contain all the HTML files and
documentation provided on the web site.</p>


<h3>1.1. Getting released sources</h3>

<p>Every release comes with full sources and these are available from
<a href="http://www.redland.opensource.ac.uk/dist/source/">http://www.redland.opensource.ac.uk/dist/source/</a> master site as well as the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/librdf/">SourceForge site</a>.
</p>


<h3>1.2. Getting nightly source snapshots</h3>

<p>Each night a snapshot distribution is attempted using the current
development sources (that may not even be in the CVS), using the
<code>make dist</code> target of the automake system.  If this target
completes, these snapshots are then made available from:
<a href="http://www.redland.opensource.ac.uk/dist/snapshots/source/">http://www.redland.opensource.ac.uk/dist/snapshots/source/</a>
(binary snapshot releases are also attempted each night from the
same sources).
</p>

<h3>1.3. Getting the sources from CVS</h3>

<pre>
  # sh, bash, ...
  CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ilrt.org:/cvsroot
  export CVSROOT
  # csh, tcsh, ...
  setenv CVSROOT :pserver:anonymous@cvs.ilrt.org:/cvsroot

  cvs login
Logging in to :pserver:anonymous@cvs.ilrt.org:2401/cvsroot
CVS password: 
  [return]

  cvs checkout redland

  cd redland
</pre>

<p>At this stage, or after a <code>cvs update</code> you will
need to create the automake and autoconf derived files, as described
below in <a href="#sec-create-configure">Create the configure program</a>
by using the <code>autogen.sh</code> script.</p>

<p>Building Redland in this way requires some particular development
tools not needed when building from snapshot releases - automake,
autoconf and swig.  The <code>autogen.sh</code> script checks for the
appropriate versions.</p>



<h2>2. Configuring and building</h2>

<p>Redland uses the GNU automake and autoconf to handle system
dependency checking.  It is developed and built on x86 Linux (Redhat),
but is also used extensively locally on various versions of
sparc Sun Solaris 2.x.  I also test it via
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>s'
compile farm and it builds on Debian Linux (x86, Alpha, PPC and
Sparc), FreeBSD (x86) and Apple OSX.</p>


<h3><a id="sec-create-configure" name="sec-create-configure"></a>2.1. Create <code>configure</code> program</h3>

<p>If there is no <code>configure</code> program, you can create it 
by running the <code>autogen.sh</code> script, as long as you have the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/automake.html">automake</a> and
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html">autoconf</a>
tools.  This is done by:</p>
<pre>
  ./autogen.sh
</pre>
<p>and you can also pass along arguments intended for configure (see
below for what these are):</p>
<pre>
  ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr/local/somewhere
</pre>
<p>Alternatively you can run the automake and autoconf programs by
hand with:</p>
<pre>
  aclocal; autoheader; automake --add-missing; autoconf
</pre>
<p>(Ignore any warnings from autoconf about AC_TRY_RUN, it is caused
by an autoconf macro and seems to be an autoconf bug.)</p>

<h3>2.2. Options for <code>configure</code></h3>

<p>See also the generic GNU installation instructions in 
<a href="INSTALL">INSTALL</a> for information about general options
such as <code>--prefix</code> etc.</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>--with-bdb=ROOT</code><br /></dt>
<dd><p>Enable use of the Berkeley / Sleepycat DB library installed at
<em>ROOT</em>.  That means <em>ROOT</em><code>/include</code> must
contain the BDB header <code>db.h</code> and <em>ROOT</em><code>/lib</code>
must contain the library <code>libdb.a</code> (or whatever shared library
version/name your system uses).</p>

<p>Berkeley DB is now known as Sleepycat DB (after version 2) and
distributed and supported by
<a href="http://www.sleepycat.com/">SleepyCat Software</a>.
Versions 4.1.24, 4.0.14, 3.3.11, 3.2.9, 3.1.17, 3.1.14, 2.7.7 and 2.4.14
have been tested and work.  Some systems do
not come installed with a working Berkeley/Sleepycat DB so on those
systems, Redland will have no persistent storage unless BDB is built
separately and enabled via this option.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: If you change installed versions of BDB then you will
need to re-configure Redland carefully to let it discover the
features of the newer BDB as follows:</p>
<pre>
  rm -f config.cache
  make clean
  ./configure ... # any configure arguments here
</pre>
<p>(plus you might need to use the
<code>db</code><em>X</em><code>_upgrade</code>
utility to update the BDB database files to the formats supported by
the newer version <em>X</em> - see the BDB documentation to find out
if this is required.)</p>

<p>If the BerkeleyDB is installed in different places from
<em>ROOT</em><code>/lib</code> (library) and
<em>ROOT</em><code>/include</code> (header) or
the library name is something that can't be worked out automatically,
then you can use the next ste of options to specify them.</p>

<p>If all of the BDB options are omitted, Redland will do
a best efforts guess to find the newest BDB installation but
this may not work for all configurations.</p>
</dd>

<dt><code>--with-bdb-lib=</code><em>LIBDIR</em><br /></dt>
<dt><code>--with-bdb-include=</code><em>INCDIR</em><br /></dt>
<dt><code>--with-bdb-name=</code><em>NAME</em><br /></dt>
<dd><p>Use Berkeley DB with the installed library in <em>LIBDIR</em>
and the <code>db.h</code> header in <em>INCDIR</em> and
the installed library called <em>NAME</em>
like <code>-l</code><em>NAME</em>.  This is relative to <em>LIBDIR</em>.
All of these options can be omitted and <code>configure</code> will
try to find or guess the values from the system.</p>

<p>For example, to compile redland on OSX with
<a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">fink</a>
might require a configure line something like this:</p>
<pre>
  ./configure --with-bdb-lib=/sw/lib --with-bdb-include=/sw/include/db3
</pre>
<p>The name of the BDB library was correctly discovered for this
configuration, as <code>db-3.3</code></p>

<p>If all of the BDB options are omitted, Redland will do
a best efforts guess to find the newest BDB installation but
this may not work for all configurations.</p>
</dd>

<dt><code>--with-java</code>(=<em>JAVA</em>)<br /></dt>
<dt><code>--with-perl</code>(=<em>PERL</em>)<br /></dt>
<dt><code>--with-php</code>(=<em>PHP</em>)<br /></dt>
<dt><code>--with-python</code>(=<em>PYTHON</em>)<br /></dt>
<dt><code>--with-ruby</code>(=<em>RUBY</em>)<br /></dt>
<dt><code>--with-tcl</code>(=<em>TCL</em>)<br /></dt>
<dd><p>Enable the given language APIs - the default is to build
none automatically.  If the optional argument is given, choose
the command to use.  For example <code>--with-ruby=ruby1.8</code>
will pick the ruby1.8 binary.
</p></dd>

<dt><code>--with-jdk=</code><em>DIR</em><br /></dt>
<dd><p>Choose the location of the Java JDK to use for building
the Java API with Java JNI.  If omitted, Redland will guess likely
locations but this is not guaranteed to work.
</p></dd>


<dt><code>--with-libwww</code><br /></dt>
<dd><p>Enable use of the W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/Library/">libwww</a>,
if available.  configure will automatically enable this if
the <code>libwww-config</code> program can be found in the path unless
disabled by setting this option to <em>no</em>.  libwww is not used
at present.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><code>--enable-parsers=LIST</code><br /></dt>
<dd><p>Select the list of RDF parsers to be included if the are availble.  The
valid list of RDF parsers is currently only <code>raptor</code> (the default)
since the older repat parser has been removed.  Raptor uses either of
libxml2 (prefered) or expat.  Redland requires the Raptor parser for
other functionality, so it cannot be disabled.
</p></dd>

<dt><code>--with-openssl-digests</code><br /></dt>
<dd><p>Enable digests provided by the
<a href="http://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a>
libcrypto library (MD5, SHA1 and RIPEMD160) if the library is
available. configure will automatically enable this unless disabled
by setting this option to <em>no</em>.</p></dd>

<dt><code>--with-raptor=</code> <code>system</code> or <code>internal</code><br /></dt>
<dd><p>
This option tells redland to use either the system installed version
of raptor or the internal version.  If the option is omittted,
redland will guess and choose either the system one, if new enough or
the internal one (always present).  If <code>--with-raptor=system</code>
is used and redland discovers that the system raptor is too old,
a warning will be given but the configuration will continue.
</p></dd>


<dt><code>--with-xml-parser=NAME</code><br /></dt>
<dd><p>Pick an XML parser to use for Raptor - either <code>libxml</code>
(default) or <code>expat</code>.  If this option is not given,
either will be used, with libxml preferred if both are present.
libxml must be present as a system library but expat is always available
since it is provided inside Redland.</p>

<p>Raptor has been tested with various combinations of these libraries
that are described further in the Raptor
<a href="http://www.redland.opensource.ac.uk/raptor/INSTALL.html">install</a>
documentation.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><code>--enable-digests=LIST</code><br /></dt>
<dd><p>Select the list of digests to be included if the are availble.  The
valid list of digests are: <code>md5 sha1 ripem160</code> (the default).  The
digest functions can be provided by external libraries such as
the <a href="http://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a>
libcrypto library or by provided portable
versions (only MD5 supported in this release).</p></dd>

</dl>


<p><b>WARNING</b> If the libwww or Sleepycat/Berkeley DB libraries
are installed in a non-default directory, when the final linking
occurs, the libraries may not be found at run time.  To fix this you
will need to use a system-specific method of passing this information
to the run-time loader.  On most systems you can set the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to include the directory where
the libwww libraries are found. (On OSX this is DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH)
You can also configure it via a
system wide file - see the <code>ld</code>, <code>ld.so</code>
or<code>ld.so.1</code> manual pages for details.  The alternative, to
link libwww statically, works but is difficult to enable.</p>


<h3>2.3 Configuring</h3>

<p>If everything is in the default place, do:</p>
<pre>
   ./configure
</pre>

<p>More commonly you will be doing something like this, when
giving the installation location of Berkeley/Sleeypcat DB:</p>
<pre>
   ./configure --with-bdb=/usr/local/berkeleydb
</pre>

<p>If you are having problems with configuring several times when
adding or removing options, you may have to tidy up first with either of these:</p>
<pre>
   make clean
   rm -f config.cache
</pre>

<h3>2.4 Compiling</h3>

<pre>
   make
</pre>


<h2 id="sec-testing">2.5. Testing</h2>

<p>You can build and run the built-in tests for Redland with:</p>
<pre>
    make check
</pre>
<p>which should emit lots of exciting test messages to the screen but
conclude with something like:<br />
  <code>All </code><em>n</em><code> tests passed</code><br />
if everything works correctly.</p>

<p>If the language-specific <code>--with-perl</code> etc. arguments
have been given to <code>configure</code>, the top-level
<code>make check</code> will run these tests for the enabled languages
in addition to the core tests.  These <em>may fail</em> if
the main redland libraries (librdf and libraptor) are not
installed. So in this case you should do:</p>
<pre>
   make install
</pre>
<p>before trying to run the language-specific tests.
</p>

<p>The language-specific tests can also be built and run with:</p>
<pre>
   cd language
   make check
</pre>

<p>(If you have got all the required subsidiary development tools,
you can also do <code>make distcheck</code> which does a longer
check that the distribution installation, configuring and building
works.  This does not perform any additional core testing).</p>



<h3 id="sec-install">2.6 Installing the library</h3>

<p>To install the C library (static and shared typically) plus the
interface header (.h) files do:</p>

<pre>
   make install
</pre>

<p>The language-specific interfaces are installed in this step when
they are enabled with the <code>--with-perl</code> etc. arguments of
<code>configure</code></p>

<p>Otherwise, the language-specific installations can be made with:</p>
<pre>
  cd language
  make install
</pre>



<h2>3. Using the library</h2>

<p>Once the library has been configured and built, there are 
several C example programs that can be used.  They are 
in the <code>examples</code> sub-directory and can be built with:</p>
<pre>
   cd examples
   make
</pre>
<p>(This may be done by the initial 'make' automatically).</p>

<p>There are many examples for all of the language interfaces in the
corresponding sub-directories such as <code>perl/example.pl</code>
which may be easier to modify.</p>

<p>If no Berkeley DB was found by configure, some of the examples will fail
since there is no on-disk storage system available.  To change them
to use the in-memory hashes, edit the lines reading something like</p>
<pre>
  storage=librdf_new_storage("hashes", "test", "hash_type='bdb',dir='.'");
</pre>
<p>to read</p>
<pre>
  storage=librdf_new_storage("hashes", "test", "hash_type='memory',dir='.'");
</pre>



<h3>3.1. <a href="example1.c">example1.c</a></h3>

<p><code>example1</code> uses a RDF parser, if you have one available, to
parse a URI of RDF/XML content, store it in multple Berkeley DB
hashes on the disk and run queries against them.  It takes two
arguments, the first the URI of the RDF/XML content (or
<code>file:</code><em>filename</em>) and the second, optional one, is the
name of the RDF parser to use.  At present these can be
<code>sirpac</code> or <code>libwww</code></p>

<h3>3.2. <a href="example2.c">example2.c</a></h3>

<p><code>example2</code> does not use a RDF parser, but reads from a
simple triple dump format and again stores the data on disk in
multiple Berkeley DB hashes.</p>

<h3>3.3. <a href="example3.c">example3.c</a></h3>

<p><code>example3</code> contains a 10 line main program that creates
an RDF model, a statement, adds it to the model and stores it on
disk.</p>


<h3>3.4 rdfproc</h3>

<p>The <code>rdfproc</code> utility in the utils directory
extensively exercises the Redland API and can demonstrate
many ways to store, search and manipulate the graph from C.
