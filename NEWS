   store.

   Added initial simple threading support (patches by Seth Ladd)
   Greatly  improved  Python API using 2.2 features (Edd Dumbill and Matt
   Biddulph)
   Updated  Perl,  Python  and  Java  APIs to always return new nodes and
   statements, removing the need to consider shared object issues.
   Updated serializing to RDF/XML to handle datatype literals

   Raptor NEWS for changes since 0.9.8.

2003-02-13 Redland 0.9.12 Released

   FORMAT CHANGE The persistent storage format was changed to support RDF
   typed  literals  and  this  will  require  an  upgrade of any existing
   Berkeley/Sleepycat  DB  stores created by Redland 0.9.11 or earlier. A
   utility  redland-db-upgrade  is provided that creates an updated store
   from an existing one.
   API  CHANGE  Iterator  and Stream classes. The next/get_next method is
   split  into  get_object  always  returning  a  shared  object and next
   methods.  get_context  method  added. (get_object is called current in
   higher level language APIs)
   API CHANGE Model class. Method add_statement no longer takes ownership
   of the passed in statement. The caller now retains ownership.
   API  CHANGE  Model  class.  Method  add_statements no longer frees the
   passed in librdf_stream; the caller must free it now.
   API CHANGE Node and Model classes. Added RDF Datatyped Literals. Other
   literal is_wf_xml constructors and methods deprecated.
   API  CHANGE  All  literals methods and constructors have no mention of
   the never-used or supported XML Space argument which is not part of an
   RDF literal.
   Added  a  script  utils/update-api-0912.pl  to  help  automate the API
   changes  as  far  as  possible  or  warn  about  those  that cannot be
   automatically updated.
   Added  contexts - Statements added to Model (when using a Storage that
   supports  contexts)  can  take  an  optional Node, returned by the new
   get_context method on Iterator and Stream classes.
   Many  portability  and compiling fixes (OSX, gcc 3.x, FreeBSD, non-gcc
   compiler)
   Java API classes. Add finished() method replacing useless finalize().
   Use Raptor message callbacks to get parser warnings and errors
   Build  Java  API working around the stupid things recent SWIG versions
   do.
   Make Redland work with BDB/Sleepycat DB v4 (as well as v2 and v3)
   Python API gains pydoc comments and HTML derived version
   Perl and Python APIs now receive Redland message callbacks
   Redland  URI  class  now  registers  with Raptor rather than specially
   compile Raptor
   Added  RDF/XML Serializer class and made higher level language APIs to
   it
   Update  to  Raptor  version 0.9.8 (RDF/XML and N-Triples parser) - see
   Raptor NEWS for detailed changes since 0.9.5
   Added skeleton Ruby and PHP APIs
   Major source reorganisation.
