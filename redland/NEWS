2003-02-13 Redland Version 0.9.12 Released

   FORMAT CHANGE The persistent storage format was changed to support RDF

   utility redland-db-upgrade is provided that creates an updated store
   from an existing one.
   API CHANGE [68]Iterator and [69]Stream classes. The next/get_next
   method is split into get_object always returning a shared object and
   next methods. get_context method added. (get_object is called current
   in higher level language APIs)

   ownership of the passed in statement. The caller now retains
   ownership.
   API CHANGE [71]Model class. Method add_statements no longer frees the
   passed in librdf_stream; the caller must free it now.
   API CHANGE [72]Node and [73]Model classes. Added RDF Datatyped
   Literals. Other literal is_wf_xml constructors and methods deprecated.
   API CHANGE All literals methods and constructors have no mention of
   the never-used or supported XML Space argument which is not part of an
   RDF literal.
   Added a script [74]utils/update-api-0912.pl to help automate the API
   changes as far as possible or warn about those that cannot be
   automatically updated.
   Added contexts - Statements added to [75]Model (when using a Storage
   that supports contexts) can take an optional [76]Node, returned by the
   new get_context method on [77]Iterator and [78]Stream classes.
   Many portability and compiling fixes (OSX, gcc 3.x, FreeBSD, non-gcc
   compiler)
   [79]Java API classes. Add finished() method replacing useless
   finalize().
   Use Raptor message callbacks to get parser warnings and errors

   do.

   [82]Perl and [83]Python APIs now receive Redland message callbacks
