   --version-decimal
   Check N-Triples legal Unicode character range #x0-#x10FFFF

   Added  many  more  checks  for  bad  syntax  (mostly  illegal property
   attributes)
   Updated parseType="Collection" triples after RDF Core WG change
   Added an experimental RSS Tag Soup parser to read any pile of XML that
   has elements such as channel, image, item tags with title, description
   etc  inside  them  into coherent RSS 1.0 RDF triples. (Requires libxml
   2.5.0 or newer)
   API: Added new methods raptor_get_name, raptor_get_label.
   API:  Added  new methods raptor_set_default_generate_id_parameters and
   raptor_set_generate_id_handler to control generation of IDs.
   API: Modified utility function raptor_xml_escape_string arguments.
   Ripped  out  ISO 3166 country code parts since commercial use might be
   subject to a license fee.
   Improvements to GTK example 'grapper'.
   Several internal reorganisations for pulling out a SAX2 API, XML C14N.
   Other minor bug fixes.

   Added a GTK GUI example program grapper
   Other minor bug fixes.

2003-03-28 Version 0.9.9 Released

   Performance  improvements  -  uses  less  memory,  less repeated small
   malloc/free sequences, faster for larger files.
   Added  WWW  retrieval  - can parse from an URI as well as files, given
   either libcurl or libxml2 is available.
   Minor bug fixes.
   Various Win32 configure, building patches
   Sources updated to use autoconf 1.6+, automake 2.52+

   Fixed  accepting  illegal  xmlns:prefix=""  (prefix  without  URI  not
   allowed)
   N-Triples bnodeIDs can now have '0's
   Utility  program  rdfdump  renamed  to  rapper; name conflicted with a
   common Linux utility.

   The libraptor.3 manual page describes the changes.
   Added  support for RDF datatyped literals in RDF/XML with rdf:datatype
   attribute    on    property    elements   and   N-Triples   with   the
   "string"^^<datatypeURIref>.
   Added support for rdf:parseType="Collection" for RDF Collections
   URI class allows swappable implementation by applications.
   URI class now handles file: URIs for Win32 and Unix conventions.
   Fixes  to  enable  it  to  work  on  Apple OSX 10.1, 10.2 (also tested
   working on Linux/x86, Solaris/sparc, FreeBSD/x86)
   Many  internal  changes  to support API changes, allow it to work with
   Redland when compiled as a separate library
   Reorganised  source  into separate modules - URI, xml parser, ntriples
   parser, XML namespaces, XML qnames, locator.
   More  resilience  with  XML  errors  and  XML  parser errors - none of
   libxml2's XML test suite examples crash raptor.
