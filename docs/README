PAPERS

   The  design  and  implementation of Redland are discussed in detail in
   the paper The Design and Implementation of the Redland RDF Application
   Framework presented at the WWW10 conference, May 2001. (pre-print).

   The details of the technology of the WSE and RDN-WSE projects that are
   based  on  Redland  are reported in Web Crawling High-Quality Metadata
   using  RDF  and  Dublin Core, presented at the WWW2002 conference, May

API DOCUMENTATION

   The  API  DocBook  documentation  is  generated automatically from the
   source  code  using  the Linux 2.4 kernel kernel-doc program which you
   can  get  as  the file scripts/kernel-doc in the distribution. It then
   uses programs that convert DocBook into HTML, PS, PDF - db2html, db2ps
   and db2pdf. I need help to make them do better jobs.
