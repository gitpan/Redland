RDF::Redland 0.9.14.1 - Redland RDF Application Framework

DESCRIPTION

This is the first version of the CPAN-buildable package for the
Redland C RDF library version 0.9.14 along with the Perl interface
(RDF::Redland) which comes with full POD documentation.  It allows
you to manipulate, store and query the Resource Description Framework
(RDF) graphs from Perl.

This should(*) build with a standard CPAN install:

  perl Makefile.PL
    (creates Makefile)
  make
    (wait some time as it runs configure and builds the C libraries)
  make test
    (runs lots of C checks and the perl interface ones)
  make install

This isn't likely to work outside a POSIX system since building
the C library assumes that.  An XML parser such as expat or libxml2
is required and Sleepycat/Berkeley DB is needed if you want a
persistent store.

The main description of Redland is given below and also in README.html

CHANGES

0.9.14.1  2003-09-08
New major version of Redland

0.9.13.3  2003-09-08 (not released)  

Added patch to make the ancient Sleepycat/BDB 3.0.early (from 1999)
work - as used on one of the testers.cpan.org machines.

0.9.13.2  2003-09-07

Fixes the execution bits on files before starting the perl
Makefile.PL, gives some output and has more correct installation
instructions.  The tarball has the other language interfaces removed
and documentation for the C and non-perl APIs so the tarball size is
about 30% smaller.

0.9.13  2003-09-04 (deleted)

(*) If the above doesn't work, you can try the Redland native way:
  ./configure --with-perl
    (which writes a different Makefile :)
  make
  make check    # optional
  make install

Overview

   Redland  is  a  library  that  provides a high-level interface for RDF
   allowing  the  RDF  graph  to  be parsed from XML, stored, queried and
   manipulated.  Redland  implements  each of the RDF concepts in its own
   class  via an object based API, reflected into the other language APIs
   - Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby and Tcl. Some of the classes providing
   the  parsers,  storage  mechanisms  and  other  elements  are built as
   modules that can be added or removed as required.

   This  library  is  mature  and has been used in large systems. See the
   todo  list or the website version for an up-to-date copy, and the FAQS
   for  more  information.  Changes can be found in the NEWS file or more
   detailed changes in the ChangeLog.

   Redland provides:
     * A modular, object based library written in C
     * Java,  Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby and Tcl interfaces for manipulating
       the RDF graph and parts - Statements, Resources and Literals
     * Parsers and Serializers for reading and writing RDF as syntax.
     * Storage  for  graphs in memory and on disk via Sleepcat / Berkeley
       DB.
     * Query  APIs  for  the graph by Statement (triples) or by Nodes and
       Arcs
     * Statement  Streams  for construction, parsing, de/serialisation of
       graphs
     * Start of query language support.
     * No memory leaks so far.

   The packaged sources are available from
   http://www.redland.opensource.ac.uk/dist/source/   (master  site)  and
   also  from  the  SourceForge  site. There are nightly snapshots of the
   development version which is can also be browsed via CVSweb.

   This  library  is  free software / open source software released under
   the LGPL or MPL licenses. See LICENSE.html for full details.

Installation

   See   INSTALL.html   for   general   installation   and  configuration
   information  and  the  language  specific documents for installing the
   interfaces in Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby or Tcl.

   Further documentation is available in the documents area including the
   API document.

Mailing Lists

   The  Redland  mailing lists discuss the development and use of Redland
   and Raptor as well as future plans and announcement of releases.
