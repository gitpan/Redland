RDF::Redland 0.9.13 - Redland RDF Application Framework

DESCRIPTION

This is the first version of the CPAN-buildable package for the
Redland C RDF library along with the perl interface (RDF::Redland)
which comes with full POD documentation.  It allows you to
manipulate, store and query the Resource Description Framework (RDF)
graphs from Perl.

This should(*) build with a standard CPAN install:

  perl Makefile.PL
    (wait some time as it configures and builds the C libraries)
  make
    (doesn't do much)
  make install

This isn't likely to work outside a POSIX system since building
the C library assumes that kind of system.

The description of Redland are given below and also in README.html

LICENSE: LGPL/MPL

(*) If the above doesn't work, you can try the Redland native way:
  ./configure
    (which writes a different Makefile :)
  make
  make install

Overview

   Redland  is  a  library  that  provides a high-level interface for RDF
   allowing  the  RDF  graph  to  be parsed from XML, stored, queried and
   manipulated.  Redland  implements  each of the RDF concepts in its own
   class  via an object based API, reflected into the other language APIs
   - Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby and Tcl. Some of the classes providing
   the  parsers,  storage  mechanisms  and  other  elements  are built as
   modules that can be added or removed as required.

   This  library  is  mature  and has been used in large systems. See the
   todo  list or the website version for an up-to-date copy, and the FAQS
   for  more  information.  Changes can be found in the NEWS file or more
   detailed changes in the ChangeLog.

   Redland provides:
     * A modular, object based library written in C
     * Java,  Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby and Tcl interfaces for manipulating
       the RDF graph and parts - Statements, Resources and Literals
     * Parsers and Serializers for reading and writing RDF as syntax.
     * Storage  for  graphs in memory and on disk via Sleepcat / Berkeley
       DB.
     * Query  APIs  for  the graph by Statement (triples) or by Nodes and
       Arcs
     * Statement  Streams  for construction, parsing, de/serialisation of
       graphs
     * Start of query language support.
     * No memory leaks so far.
