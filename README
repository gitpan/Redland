                       Redland RDF Library Perl Binding

[1]Dave Beckett

Overview

   [2]Redland is a library that provides a high-level interface for the
   Resource Description Framework (RDF) allowing the RDF graph to be
   parsed from XML, stored, queried and manipulated. Redland implements
   each of the RDF concepts in its own class via an object based API,
   reflected into language APIs. Several classes providing functionality
   such as for parsers, storage are built as modules that can be loaded
   at compile or run-time as required.

   The redland-perl package provides the higher level language APIs to
   Redland in Perl. For further information see the [3]Redland Perl
   documentation

   [5]SourceForge site. The development Subversion sources can also be

   libraries are available from the [7]download site.
